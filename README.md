# Citibike_Analysis

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I was tasked with overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.


Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
